# Introduction to AI Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the comprehensive guide to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This textbook is designed for undergraduate CS/AI/Robotics students and covers the essential concepts needed to understand and build intelligent robotic systems.

## Overview

This textbook is organized into four comprehensive modules:

1. **Module 1: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Learn the fundamentals of ROS 2 architecture, nodes, topics, services, and actions
2. **Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Explore simulation environments for safe robot development and testing
3. **Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Understand AI-driven perception, navigation, and learning systems
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Integrate voice, vision, and action systems for autonomous robots

## Learning Approach

Each module combines theoretical foundations with hands-on practical exercises. You'll work with real robotics frameworks like ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, and AI technologies to build increasingly sophisticated robotic systems.

:::info Learning Objectives
By the end of this textbook, you will be able to:
- Design and implement ROS 2-based robotic systems
- Create and test robots in simulation environments
- Integrate AI perception and planning systems
- Build voice-commanded autonomous robots
:::

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to establish the foundational knowledge required for all subsequent modules. Each module builds upon previous concepts, so we recommend following the sequence presented in this textbook.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this textbook, you should have:
- Basic programming experience (preferably in Python)
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Access to a computer capable of running robotics simulation software

:::caution Safety First
Always follow responsible robotics practices and safety guidelines when implementing physical robotic systems.
