# Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

This module focuses on creating and working with digital twins - virtual representations of physical robots and their environments. You'll learn to simulate robotic systems in realistic environments before deploying to real hardware, ensuring safety and reducing development costs.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments
- Create physics-accurate humanoid models with proper sensors
- Implement sensor simulation (LiDAR, Depth Camera, IMU)
- Build and customize virtual environments for testing
- Execute sensor-actuator loops in realistic physics simulation

## Module Overview

Digital twin technology enables safe and efficient robot development. This module covers:

- **Physics Simulation**: Understanding gravity, collisions, and joint dynamics
- **Sensor Simulation**: Implementing LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMU sensors
- **Environment Building**: Creating virtual worlds for robot testing
- **Unity Visualization**: Alternative visualization and simulation tools
- **Mini-Project**: Creating a complete humanoid digital twin

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of 3D coordinate systems
- Familiarity with physics concepts (gravity, collisions)

## Getting Started

This module builds directly on the ROS 2 concepts from Module 1. You'll connect your ROS 2 nodes to simulation environments and test the control systems you developed previously.

:::warning Safety First
Simulation allows for safe testing of complex behaviors that would be dangerous to test on real hardware. Use this opportunity to experiment and iterate quickly.
