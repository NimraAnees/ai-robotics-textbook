# Module 1: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This module introduces the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which serves as the communication backbone for robotic systems. You'll learn how to design, implement, and connect different components of a robot system through ROS 2's distributed architecture.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture (nodes, topics, services, actions)
- Implement ROS 2 nodes in Python using rclpy
- Create and configure URDF models for humanoid robots
- Design sensor-actuator-control pipelines
- Build a complete ROS 2 control stack

## Module Overview

ROS 2 provides the essential infrastructure for robot communication and coordination. This module covers:

- **ROS 2 Architecture**: Understanding nodes, topics, services, and actions
- **Python Integration**: Using rclpy for ROS 2 development
- **URDF Modeling**: Creating robot descriptions for humanoid systems
- **Control Pipelines**: Designing sensor-actuator loops
- **Mini-Project**: Building a complete ROS 2 control stack

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of object-oriented programming concepts
- Familiarity with Linux/Unix command line

## Getting Started

Begin with Chapter 1 to understand the core architecture of ROS 2, then progress through each topic systematically. Each chapter includes practical exercises to reinforce your understanding.

:::tip Pro Tip
Practice each concept in the simulation environment before moving to the next topic. Understanding ROS 2 fundamentals is crucial for success in later modules.
