# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

This capstone module integrates all previous learning into a complete system that can understand natural language commands, perceive its environment, and execute complex tasks. You'll build an autonomous humanoid robot that responds to voice commands.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Implement voice processing systems using Whisper
- Design LLM-based cognitive planning that translates to ROS actions
- Integrate multi-modal interaction (speech, vision, gesture)
- Perform object recognition and manipulation
- Execute end-to-end tasks based on voice commands

## Module Overview

The culmination of your robotics education brings together all concepts learned. This module covers:

- **Voice Processing**: Using Whisper for speech-to-text conversion
- **Cognitive Planning**: LLM-based reasoning for task execution
- **Multi-Modal Integration**: Combining vision, language, and action
- **Object Recognition**: Identifying and manipulating objects
- **Capstone Project**: Autonomous humanoid executing voice commands

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Completed all previous modules
- Understanding of AI/ML concepts from Module 3
- Experience with ROS 2 control systems from Module 1

## Getting Started

This module integrates all components from previous modules into a unified system. You'll connect voice processing to your AI planning systems and execute complex tasks in simulation.
