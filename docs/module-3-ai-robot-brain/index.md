# Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

This module introduces AI-driven perception and navigation systems using NVIDIA Isaac tools. You'll learn how to implement intelligent behaviors that allow robots to perceive their environment, navigate autonomously, and learn from experience.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Implement VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) systems
- Design navigation pipelines for autonomous robot movement
- Apply perception algorithms for environment understanding
- Train reinforcement learning models for bipedal locomotion
- Transfer learned behaviors from simulation to reality

## Module Overview

Modern robotics requires intelligent systems that can perceive, reason, and act. This module covers:

- **Isaac Sim**: Photorealistic simulation for synthetic data generation
- **Isaac ROS**: VSLAM, navigation, and perception tools
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Training locomotion and manipulation behaviors
- **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Adapting simulation-trained models for real robots
- **Mini-Project**: Building complete perception and navigation stack

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Completed Modules 1 and 2
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with neural networks and training processes

## Getting Started

This module integrates the simulation environment from Module 2 with AI systems. You'll implement perception algorithms that work with the sensor data from your simulated robots.

:::info Note
This module requires access to GPU resources for training AI models. Ensure your development environment meets the requirements for NVIDIA Isaac tools.
