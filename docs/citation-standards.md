# Academic Citation Standards

This document outlines the citation standards and academic integrity guidelines for the AI Robotics Textbook.

## General Citation Principles

### Accuracy and Verification
- All claims, algorithms, and concepts must be backed by reputable sources
- Sources must be verified for technical accuracy before inclusion
- Primary sources should be preferred over secondary sources
- All citations must be accessible and verifiable

### Source Types
The textbook recognizes the following source categories:

#### Primary Sources
- Peer-reviewed journal articles
- Conference proceedings
- Technical documentation from official sources (ROS, NVIDIA, etc.)
- Academic textbooks
- Patents and technical standards

#### Secondary Sources
- Educational materials and tutorials
- Blog posts and technical articles
- Community documentation
- News articles and reports

## Citation Formats

### Academic Papers
```
Author, A. A., & Author, B. B. (Year). Title of the paper. *Journal Name*, Volume(Issue), pages. https://doi.org/xx.xxxx/xxxxx
```

Example:
```
Quigley, M., Gerkey, B., & Smart, W. D. (2009). ROS: an open-source Robot Operating System. *ICRA Workshop on Open Source Software*, 3(3.2), 5. https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jessica/cs155/ROS.pdf
```

### Technical Documentation
```
Organization. (Year). *Document title*. URL
```

Example:
```
Open Robotics. (2022). *ROS 2 Documentation*. https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/
```

### Conference Papers
```
Author, A. A. (Year). Title of paper. *Proceedings of Conference Name*, pages. Publisher.
```

Example:
```
Macenski, S., et al. (2022). ROS 2 Design: Improving the Robot Operating System for Production Environments. *IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation*, 1234-1240. IEEE.
```

### Books
```
Author, A. A. (Year). *Title of book*. Publisher.
```

Example:
```
Siciliano, B., & Khatib, O. (2016). *Springer Handbook of Robotics*. Springer.
```

## In-Text Citation Format

### Direct Quotes
When directly quoting a source, include the page number:
```
According to Smith (2020), "the robot's performance improved significantly" (p. 145).
```

### Paraphrasing
When paraphrasing information:
```
The new algorithm showed significant improvements in navigation accuracy (Johnson & Lee, 2021).
```

### Multiple Sources
When citing multiple sources:
```
Several studies have demonstrated this effect (Brown, 2019; Davis et al., 2020; Wilson, 2021).
```

## Academic Integrity Guidelines

### Original Work
- All content must be original writing with no plagiarism
- Proper attribution must be given to all sources
- Ideas borrowed from other works must be clearly cited
- Code examples should be clearly attributed or developed specifically for the textbook

### Reproducibility
- All experiments and results must be described with sufficient detail for reproduction
- Code examples must be tested and verified to work as described
- Simulation results should include parameters and conditions for verification

### Ethical Considerations
- All content must address ethical implications of AI and robotics
- Safety considerations and responsible development practices must be covered
- Potential negative consequences of technology should be discussed

## Reputable Sources

### Preferred Sources
- IEEE Xplore Digital Library
- ACM Digital Library
- ScienceDirect
- arXiv preprint server
- Official technical documentation (ROS, NVIDIA Isaac, etc.)
- Peer-reviewed robotics journals

### Source Evaluation Criteria
When evaluating sources, consider:
- **Authority**: Is the author an expert in the field?
- **Accuracy**: Is the information factually correct and verifiable?
- **Currency**: Is the information up-to-date for the field?
- **Coverage**: Is the scope of the source appropriate for the topic?

## Reference Management

### Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)
- Always include DOIs when available
- Use the format: https://doi.org/xx.xxxx/xxxxx
- Verify DOI links are functional

### URLs and Web Sources
- Include access dates for web sources
- Use the format: URL (Accessed: Month Day, Year)
- Verify URLs are accessible and content is stable

Example:
```
OpenAI. (2023). *GPT-4 Technical Report*. https://openai.com/research/gpt-4 (Accessed: June 15, 2023).
```

## Special Considerations for Robotics/AI Content

### Software and Framework Citations
When citing software frameworks:
```
Open Robotics. (2022). *Robot Operating System (ROS) 2*. Version Humble Hawksbill. https://www.ros.org/
```

### Dataset Citations
When citing datasets:
```
Author, A. A. (Year). *Dataset Title* [Dataset]. Publisher/Repository. https://doi.org/xx.xxxx/xxxxx
```

### Preprint Servers
For arXiv and similar preprint servers:
```
Author, A. A., & Author, B. B. (Year). Title of paper. *arXiv preprint*. arXiv:YYMM.NNNNN [cs.RO]
```

## Verification Checklist

Before finalizing any content, verify:
- [ ] All claims are supported by appropriate sources
- [ ] All sources are from reputable venues
- [ ] Citations follow the required format
- [ ] In-text citations match the reference list
- [ ] All quoted material is properly attributed
- [ ] All figures and tables from external sources are properly credited
- [ ] Academic integrity standards are maintained throughout

## Style Consistency

### Capitalization
- Journal names: *Italic Title Case*
- Conference names: *Italic Title Case*
- Book titles: *Italic Title Case*
- Article titles: Sentence case (only proper nouns capitalized)

### Punctuation
- Use periods after all citation elements
- Separate elements with commas
- Use parentheses for years and page numbers
- Maintain consistency in abbreviation usage

This citation standard ensures that all content in the AI Robotics Textbook maintains high academic standards and provides readers with verifiable, authoritative information.
